## Rug Pull Contracts

1. SafeUkraineInu

The dictionary scammer is a serial fraudster who has deployed over 9,000 scam tokens across three different blockchains – Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. We refer to them as the dictionary scammer because they use dictionary words for the variable names in their tokens’ constructor and transfer functions.

The source code of each token deployed by this scammer has been edited to enable two exploits at once: a honeypot and a hidden mint. This means that 1) the buyers of these tokens are blocked from reselling them, and 2) at any time, the dictionary scammer can mint any number of new tokens — even a number exceeding that token's declared maximum supply.

The name of each token is also clearly designed to trick investors. SafeUkraineInu, for example, impersonates the legitimate donation token Ukraine Inu, and its ticker, $SUI, is identical to that of the more popular Sui token, which has the same symbol.

The dictionary scammer’s entire rug pull process is visible on the blockchain. The typical steps in this process are:

The scammer deploys the scam token
The scammer pairs either Ether (ETH) or Binance Coin (BNB) with this token in a Uniswap or PancakeSwap liquidity pool
The scammer waits for users to swap ETH/BNB for this token
The scammer mints an absurdly large number of new tokens — often more than 100x this token’s original supply
The scammer swaps those tokens for ETH/BNB, draining the liquidity pool and making a 0.1 - 5 ETH profit per rug pull
